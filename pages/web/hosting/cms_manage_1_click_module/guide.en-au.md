### Delete your module

> [!warning]
>
> Backing up your data is an essential part of the [securing of your websites](https://docs.ovh.com/au/en/hosting/secure-website/). We recommend you to download regularly your data backup on a local device, such as an USB drive or external hard drive, following the instructions in this [guide](https://docs.ovh.com/au/en/hosting/export-a-website/).
>

#### Step 1: identify the database linked to your module <a name="step1"></a>

To delete your 1-click module, you must first identify its database with **certainty**. Go to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com.au/&ovhSubsidiary=au) and click on `Web Cloud`{.action}, `Hosting plans`{.action}, on the concerned hosting plan then on the `Databases`{.action} tab.


Otherwise, go to the `Multisite`{.action} tab. Note the `Root folder` name: this is the directory where the files that make up your 1-click module are located on the FTP server.

Then log on to the [FTP space](https://docs.ovh.com/au/en/hosting/log-in-to-storage-ftp-web-hosting/) of your hosting plan. Open the `Root folder` found earlier in the `Multisite`{.action} tab and browse to the configuration file for your module:

- WordPress: **"wp-config.php"** (the database name appears as **"DB_NAME"**).
- Joomla!: **"configuration.php"** (the database name appears under **"public $db"**).
- Drupal: **"settings.php"** (Go to the **"sites"** folder then open the **"default"** directory. The database name appears under the name **"database"**).
- Prestashop: **"parameters.php"** (To find it, go to the **"app"** folder, then click on **"config"**. The name of your module’s database will appear as **"database_name"**).

#### Step 2: backup your data

To back up your website, follow the instructions of this [guide](https://docs.ovh.com/au/en/hosting/export-a-website/) to retrieve its files from the FTP space of your hosting plan and its database.

#### Step 3: delete your module

> [!alert]
>
> Deleting your 1-click module and its database will also delete **all of their backups**. Deleted data cannot be retrieved later on.
>

To delete your 1-click module, go to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com.au/&ovhSubsidiary=au), click on `Web Cloud`{.action}, `Hosting plans`{.action}, on the concerned hosting plan then on `1-click modules`{.action}.

Then click on the `...`{.action} button to the right of the line related to your module then click on `Delete the module`{.action}.

> [!warning]
>
> Deleting your 1-click module **will not automatically delete its database**. If you launch the installation of a new module without having previously deleted the database from the previous one and if your hosting plan does not allow the automatic creation of another database, the message "[An error has occurred loading the information (You need at least one free database)](https://docs.ovh.com/au/en/hosting/error-frequently-1-click-modules/#an-error-has-occurred-loading-the-information-you-need-at-least-one-free-database)" will appear on your control panel.
>
> If you have a [Personal Hosting](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-au/web-hosting/personal-offer/) offer or if you already created all four databases of your [Professional](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-au/web-hosting/professional-offer/) or [Performance Hosting](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-au/web-hosting/performance-offer/), you will need to delete the database identified in [step 1](#step1) **BEFORE** creating a new 1-click module.
>

To complete the removal of your module, in the `Web Cloud`{.action}, `Hosting plans`{.action} sections, within the relevant hosting plan of your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com.au/&ovhSubsidiary=au), go to the `Databases`{.action} tab, then click on the `...`{.action} button on the right of the line concerning your database and on `Delete database`{.action}.

Before attempting to install a new module again, verify that the previously requested removal tasks have been completed in the `Ongoing jobs`{.action} tab.

### Best practices

Secure your website by following the instructions in this [guide](https://docs.ovh.com/au/en/hosting/secure-website/).
